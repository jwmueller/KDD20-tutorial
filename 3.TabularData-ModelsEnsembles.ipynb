    "Consider the dataset shown below in panel **(A)** with 2 features (one per axis), involving a regression task with the color intensity of each datapoint indicating values of the target-variable.  If we train a decision tree model on this data, the tree splits might be selected as in **(B)**, with the resulting  regression function learned by the decision tree shown in **(C)**.\n",

    "We can train multiple decision tree models as shown in **(D)**, obtaining different predictors in each training run if some randomness is introduced (eg. via: subsampling of the data used to fit each tree, or random-selection of feature in each split). If we simply average the predictions of each decision tree, the resulting ensemble-model produces predictions shown in **(E)**. Note that these ensemble predictions appear much better suited for the data from **(A)**, and such ensembling is the strategy Random Forests use to produce much higher accuracy than individual decision trees.\n",

    "**Desirable Ensemble Characteristics:** Let $f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_{9}$ denote 9 different trained predictors, where $f_j(x)$ is the $j$th model's prediction for a datapoint with feature-values $x$ (predicted class-probabilities in classification).  We can construct an ensemble-predictor $f_*(x) = \\frac{1}{9} \\sum_{j=1}^{9} f_j(x)$ by averaging the predictions of the individual models as graphically depicted in **(E)** above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are doing binary classification and each individual predictor $f_j$ is extremely-confident outputting either 0 or 1 for its estimated probability that a datapoint belongs to the positive class. Assume each $f_j$ \n",
    "has error-rate = 0.3, that is, there is a 30% chance this predictor makes the wrong prediction given a new datapoint sampled from the underlying data-generating distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the predictions of $f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_{9}$ are completely identical for all $x$ (i.e. these predictors make highly correlated errors), then the error-rate of $f_*$ will also obviously be 0.3 and nothing has been gained from ensembling.  At the opposite extreme, suppose these predictors make statistically independent errors. In this case, $f_*(x)$ only makes an error if at least 5 of the predictors are wrong, which happens with probability $\\displaystyle = \\sum_{k=5}^{9} {9 \\choose k} 0.3^k (1 - 0.3)^{9-k} \\le 0.1$, so the error-rate of the ensemble is far lower than the error-rate of the individual predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the accuracy of our ensemble will improve the more individual predictors we combine and the less-correlated their errors are. Two ways to reduce this correlation, i.e. increase the *diversity* of the ensemble, are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Train completely different types of models that tend to learn different types of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Train different models using different subsets of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, our individual predictors $f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_{9}$ will have different error-rates, in which case we prefer to construct a *weighted* ensemble: $f_*(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{9} w_j f_j(x)$, where the weights $w_j$ sum to 1 and are chosen to favor the more-accurate predictors.

For detailed descriptions of each model type, see: ([Boehmke, 2020: Chapters 8-13](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/)).\n",

    "\n",
    "- LightGBM/CatBoost (and the similar but older XGBoost) are currently the most popular models for tabular data, [almost always used by top Kaggle competitors](https://towardsdatascience.com/four-ways-teams-win-on-kaggle-50e62acb87f4).  [LightGBM](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree) is one of the fastest gradient-boosting implementations, whereas [CatBoost](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7898-catboost-unbiased-boosting-with-categorical-features.pdf) offers sophisticated handling of categorical features and is more resilient to overfitting through careful regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forests and Extremely Randomized Trees tend to be robustly performant regardless of their hyperparameter-settings, fast-to-train, but are generally not as accurate as gradient-boosted trees except for smaller datasets. For large datasets, these models can produce undesirably large model files when their maximum tree-depth is uncapped (which usually helps improve their accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Neural Network is described in detail in the [**AutoGluon-Tabular** paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06505), and utilizes [learned embeddings of categorical features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06737), [shortcut-connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792), and fully-connected layers with [ReLU activations](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/reluICML.pdf), [batch-normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) and [dropout regularization](http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html). These neural networks tend to be among the better models for tabular datasets with many samples, but are often less accurate for datasets with fewer samples or a vast number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- K Nearest Neighbors is fast-to-train but slow-for-inference, and typically the least accurate model-type in AutoGluon. Exceptions where KNN outperforms the other model-types include geospatial datasets or simple prediction tasks which can be solved by memorizing the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even when they are not the most accurate models on a particular dataset, the neural network and KNN model play a key role in AutoGluon. As the rest of the models are all trees, their decision boundaries are sharp and axis-aligned. In constrast, the KNN/neural-network decision boundaries are often far smoother with relatively unconstrained geometry. These models thus provide valuable diversity to the AutoGluon ensemble.\n",

    "## Stack Ensembling\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack ensembling is another powerful ensembling technique to additionally grow ensembles and further boost their predictive accuracy ([van Veen et al, 2015](https://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/); [Wolpert, 1992](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608005800231); [Polley & Van der Laan, 2010](https://biostats.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1269&context=ucbbiostat)). The previously discussed weighted-ensemble combines the predictions of individual models via a simple linear combination, but why should this be the optimal method?\n",
    "\n",
    "In stacking, one instead trains another 'stacker' ML model that takes in the predictions of the individual 'base' models and learns how they should be best combined. This can be achieved simply by training the stacker model on a newly constructed dataset where the features are now all of the base-model predictions (concatenated together, using predicted class-probabilities in classification), and the target-values remain the same as in the original prediction task. The stacker model can rectify shortcomings of the individual base predictions and exploit interactions between them that offer enhanced predictive power ([Van der Laan et al, 2007](https://biostats.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1226&context=ucbbiostat)). But how do we know what type of model the stacker should be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't know, we can train multiple types of stacker models (just like AutoGluon originally trained multiple types of base models on the original data features). We can once again aggregate these stacker models' predictions via a weighted-ensemble, or we can add another layer of stacker models on top of them. *Multi-layer stacking* feeds the predictions output by the stacker models as inputs to additional higher layer stacker models. Iterating this process in multiple layers has been a winning strategy in prominent prediction competitions ([Koren, 2009](https://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BellKor.pdf); [Titericz & Semenov, 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge/discussion/14335)). The particular form of multi-layer stacking used in AutoGluon is shown below, using two stacking layers and $n$ types of base model-types.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/images/multistack.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\">\n",

    "By default (when stacking is specified), each stacking layer in AutoGluon simply employs the same model-types (and hyperparameter-values) as the base models trained in the above `fit()`.  AutoGluon stacker models take as input not only the predictions of the models at the previous layer, but also the original data features themselves (inputs to stackers are data features concatenated with lower-layer model predictions). The final stacking layer remains a simple weighted ensemble with weights chosen via Ensemble-Selection as described above."

    "## Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial that in `fit()`, stacker models only operate on predictions from base models for datapoints held-out during the base model's training. Otherwise there could be catastrophic overfitting, since the base model could memorize a target-value from the training data and pass this as an input feature to the stacker model.\n",
    "However, using only the validation data for learning the stacker models means these models receive little data, and quickly becomes untenable for stack ensembles with more layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, AutoGluon can utilize *bagging* (short for \"bootstrap aggregation\") to ensure stacker models are only trained on data held-out from lower layer models, while still being able to learn from the full dataset ([Breiman 1994](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/bagging.pdf); [Breiman 1996](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/tech-reports/367.pdf)). \n",
    "$k$-fold bagging is a simple ensemble method that reduces variance in the ensemble's resulting predictions. This is achieved by randomly partitioning the data into $k$ disjoint chunks (we stratify based on labels), and subsequently training $k$ different copies of a model with a different data chunk held-out from each copy. AutoGluon bags all models and each model is asked to produce out-of-fold (OOF) predictions on the chunk it did not see during training. As every  datapoint is OOF for one of the bagged model copies, this allows us to obtain OOF predictions from every model for every training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/images/bagging.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above data-partioning scheme, we would train one Neural Network for every train/validation split, one Catboost model for every split, etc. (so in total there are $k$ Neural Networks, $k$ Catboost models, etc). We call these $k$ differently-trained copies of the same model-type a *model bag*.\n",
    "\n",
    "At inference-time, new datapoints count as OOF for every model in a $k$-fold bagged ensemble. For a test datapoint, we simply average the predictions of each model in the bag and feed the resulting output into higher-layer stacker models. However there is a subtle train/test mismatch as the input features to stacker models are slightly noisier at training-time than at inference-time. This is because in training, stacker inputs are predictions from a *single* model in the bag, whereas at inference, stacker inputs are averaged predictions across all models in the bag. \n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this mismatch, AutoGluon uses *repeated* $k$-fold bagging, in which multiple (randomly chosen) sets of $k$-fold data-partitions and model-bags are maintained. With repeated bagging of multiple $k$-fold bags, each datapoint is remains OOF for 1 model in each $k$-fold bag, meaning we can average the predictions over the multiple models for which this datapoint is OOF even during training. With repeated bagging, we still average predictions over many more models during inference than during training. If we repeat the bagging $n$ times, the stacker input feature variance is $O(n^{-1})$ during training vs. $O((nk)^{-1})$ during inference; without repeated bagging these variances are $O(1)$ vs. $O(k^{-1})$, which is a far greater difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "With multi-layer stacking, AutoGluon's overall training strategy is described in the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/images/trainingalgorithm.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce predictions for obtaining a validation-score, the final set of $\\{ \\hat{Y}_m \\}_{m \\in \\mathcal{M}}$ are combined via a weighted average, with weights chosen via Ensemble-Selection. AutoGluon selects $n$, the number of bagging repeats, based on how much time remains in the user-specified limit after the first round of $k$-fold bagging. If an overall time-limit $T$ is imposed on training, then AutoGluon allows each stacking layer to run for time $T/L$, where $L$ is the number of layers (typically $L=2$ works well in practice). The alloted runtime for training each particular model in a bagging-fold of a stack-layer is divided equally between model-types; model-types that fail to (partially) train within this time are skipped and omitted from the resulting predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design makes the framework highly predictable in its behavior: both the time envelope and failure behavior are well-specified. This approach guarantees that AutoGluon can produce predictions as long as we can train at least one model on one bagging-fold within the allotted time. As we checkpoint intermediate iterations of sequentially-trained models like neural networks and boosted trees, AutoGluon can still produce a model under meager time limits. We additionally anticipate that models may fail while training and just skip to the next model in this event."

    "## What about hyperparameter tuning? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is well known among competitive data scientists that creating model ensembles via stacking/bagging tends to outperform other meta-approaches to boost models' accuracy such as *hyperparameter optimization* (HPO). This is particularly true under training-time constraints, since HPO often expends significant compute evaluating poor hyperparameter-configurations no reasonable data scientist would consider. When increasing the alloted time-budget, one would expect an AutoML system to continuously improve. However, this is not always the case with HPO methods, which can begin to heavily overfit their validation data if their search is allowed to try too many hyperparameter-configurations. Given additional runtime, AutoGluon's approach\n",
    "(for tabular data with `auto_stack` specified) is to instead train more model-types with more repeated bagging models to keep growing its ensemble. This more reliably improves predictive performance with additional runtime and resists  overfitting much better than extensive HPO [(Erickson et al, 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06505). \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the accuracy of AutoGluon-Tabular can often be further improved through hyperparameter-tuning, which you can easily utilize via the [`hyperparameter_tune` argument of `fit()`](https://autogluon.mxnet.io/api/autogluon.task.html#autogluon.task.TabularPrediction.fit) (both with or without stack-ensembling). Below we show an example only training and tuning only LightGBM models, with some user-specified [hyperparameter](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html) search-spaces for demonstration purposes (you don't need to provide these for HPO, as AutoGluon has default hyperparameter search-spaces it will consider for every model):"
