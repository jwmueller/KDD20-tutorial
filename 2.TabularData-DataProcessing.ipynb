    "The complete AutoML pipeline that translates raw data into accurate predictions involves many stages abstracted by AutoGluon's one-line `fit()`, such as:\n",
    "- Data splitting\n",
    "- Data preprocessing\n",
    "- Training of individual models\n",

    "Here we describe some basic principles to improve various stages of the pipeline, starting with how to process the given dataset. This tutorial focuses on subtle yet practically-important issues, assuming you're already familiar with overall forms of standard data processing required in most ML projects. If not, please first look at these resources: ([Rencberoglu, 2019](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning-3a5e293a5114); [D'yakonov & Semenov, 2019](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/competitive-data-science/overview-1Nh5Q)).\n",

    "**How much data to hold-out**:  Predictive performance on validation data crucially guides automated decisions about which model (or combination of models) is best, how many training iterations (i.e. epochs/boosting-rounds) to apply for iteratively-optimized models, what hyperparameter-values to use, etc. It's thus critical to use a representative validation set that facilitates accurate estimation of generalization performance. However, we do not want to hold-out too much data for validation, since then less data is available for actually training the models. Once the validation-set reaches a certain size that we can accurately estimate predictive performance, additional validation-set increases will only marginally improve our estimates. While the size of the validation data determines the *variance* of our performance-estimates, how *biased* these estimates are is determined by the number of modeling decisions we base on validation-performance. \n",
    "By default, AutoGluon selects the fraction of data to hold-out for validation as follows:"

    "Between 5,000-25,000 examples, we hold-out 10% of the data, as we want to grow validation set to a stable 2500 examples, but for larger sample-sizes, we only hold-out 1% of the data which suffices to accurately estimate validation performance. If hyperparameter-tuning is performed, we double the size of the validation set to mitigate the bias introduced from choosing many hyperparameter-values based on the same validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For smaller datasets, it can be desirable to utilize multiple train/validation splits, i.e. via [k-fold cross-validation](https://www.datavedas.com/k-fold-cross-validation/), which we discuss in the next Notebook. "

    "**Class-stratification:** In classification problems, we make sure to stratify labels between the training and validation data. Stratification simply means the proportions of each class are matched between training and validation data. This prevents a shift in the class-label-distribution that might otherwise arise simply due to random chance.  Extremely rare classes remain an issue, and AutoGluon by default simply discards all data from classes that occur <10 times (can be adjusted via `label_count_threshold` [argument of `fit()`](https://autogluon.mxnet.io/api/autogluon.task.html#autogluon.task.TabularPrediction.fit)). AutoGluon-trained models thus never predict these discarded classes (about which models could anyway learn very little), but AutoGluon automatically remembers to take them into account when evaluating predictive performance.\n",

    "**Manually specify validation data:** Whether a random training/validation split is appropriate for a particular application is hard for an AutoML system to determine. Thus AutoGluon places the burden on the user to decide this. If you have reason to believe your future test data will stem from a different distribution than the training data, you should aim to provide the validation set you believe is most representative of the test distribution. For example: data are often collected at different times, where the underlying predictive relationships vary temporally, and the goal is predict on data received at future times. Here a reasonable strategy may be to reserve your most recent data as the validation-set, to mimic the time-difference from the training data that will be encountered during inference. With AutoGluon, we can easily specify a validation-set via the `tuning_data` argument as follows:"

    "Properly processing raw data into a format suitable for ML is crucial for a successful end-to-end AutoML system.  \n",
    "AutoGluon relies on two sequential stages of data processing: \n",
    "- *model-agnostic* preprocessing that transforms the inputs to all models\n",
    "- *model-specific* preprocessing that is only applied to a copy of the data used to train a particular model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model-agnostic preprocessing classifies each feature as numeric, categorical, text, or date/time, relying partly on the [**dtype** of each column in the DataFrame](https://pbpython.com/pandas_dtypes.html). Uncategorized columns are discarded from the data, comprised of non-numeric, non-repeating fields with presumably little\n",
    "predictive value (e.g. UserIDs). To deal with missing categorical variables, we create an\n",
    "additional **Unknown** category rather than imputing them.\n",
    "This strategy is also used by AutoGluon to handle previously unseen\n",
    "categories at inference-time. Note that often observations are not\n",
    "missing at random and we want to preserve the evidence of\n",
    "absence (rather than the absence of evidence). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Word of Caution about One-hot Encoding of Categorical Features**: \n",
    "Most ML textbooks/tutorials claim that categorical features should be converted to numerical values through [one-hot encoding](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/) (OHE).  However, we do *not* recommend this as a generic model-agnostic preprocessing strategy; you should only apply OHE when passing data to a model for which this technique is particularly well-suited. OHE comes with the major downside that it explodes the dimsensionality of your data, and numerous alternative categorical-processing techniques exist ([Grover, 2019](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-deeper-into-categorical-encodings-for-machine-learning-2312acd347c8)). \n",
    "Certain models such as [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Advanced-Topics.html#categorical-feature-support)/[Catboost](https://catboost.ai/docs/features/categorical-features.html) provide special handling of categoricals, as does AutoGluon's neural network, which utilizes [learned embeddings](https://www.fast.ai/2018/04/29/categorical-embeddings/) to represent categorical data ([Erickson, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06505)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do utilize one-hot encoding, make sure to consider how your ML system will handle categorical features with: missing values, a huge number of possible categories, or previously-unseen categories encountered in future test data. One way to handle all of these issues is to provision separate OHE-dimensions to only the top $K$ most commonly-occurring categories and bin all less common (and previously-unseen/missing) categories into a single extra category."

[AWS m5.24xlarge instance with 384 GB memory](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/m5-the-next-generation-of-general-purpose-ec2-instances/)), and thus robust AutoML systems ought to run on sizeable datasets even without any chunking/distributed-processing of the data. \n",

For instance, many AutoML systems train multiple models in parallel which may lead to forking processes that duplicate datasets in memory. Similarly, when passing the generically-preprocessed data to a model, it is commmon to copy the dataset so that model-specific preprocessing won't affect the data other models receive. Without caution, additional copies of the dataset are often generated during this process or the model-training. AutoGluon's n-gram feature-generation is one particular area where memory becomes dangerous, as it often adds thousands of additional columns to the table. Here is how it is implemented:"

    "**Transductive Preprocessing**: While *supervised learning* typically assumes predictions will need to be made on future data that is currently unavailable, *transductive learning* [(Vapnik, 06)](http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~martinez/classes/778/Papers/transductive.pdf) instead only asks for predictions for one particular test dataset that is available (just without labels). For instance, many [prediction competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) follow this format, where the (unlabeled) test data is provided to contestants at the outset. While sophisticated learning algorithms have been developed specifically for the transductive setting, some accuracy-gains may be reaped simply by performing all data preprocessing on the combined training and (unlabeled) test datasets. While inappropriate for inductive supervised learning (where test data are merely supposed  provide unbiased predictive performance estimates for future data), such joint preprocessing can help in transductive settings (where in the test data: some numerical values may extend beyond their range in the training data and some categorical variables may take values previously unseen in the training data).\n",
    "This can be done in AutoGluon by passing the *unlabeled* test data as `tuning_data` (rather than *labeled* validation data):"
